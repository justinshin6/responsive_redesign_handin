        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p >The main purpose of this project is to practice the workflow of redesigning 
                a simple website. Through this three-week process, we first chose a website that might have usability problems—meaning that 
                the website is difficult to use. Then, in the first week, we focused first and making sketches and Lo-fi wireframes to 
                create our initial designs. The second week, we focused on Hi-Fi Mockups and creating a Style Guide. Finally, in the last week,
                we used HTML/CSS to create a redesigned, responsive website. Therefore, through this process, I was able to learn how to 
                redesign a website completely from scratch: starting from initial sketches to a fully redesigned website. The following 
                sections below detail my thoughts on the entire process!

    <section id="p1"class="p1">
        <h1 class="part1">Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h1>
        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p class="part1-paragraph">The website I chose is <a href="https://grandmas-kitchen-hb.edan.io/">Grandma's Country Kitchen</a> which is 
                a local restaurant in my hometown. The screenshots for the website are below: </p>

        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <h3 class="sub-section">Reasoning:</h3>
            <p class="p1-response">The reason I chose this website is because the website is painfully basic with a ton of needless information cluttered in the middle of the screen,
                 but this is one of my favorite restaurants in my hometown of Bremen, GA, so I thought it would be cool to redesign the website for a restaurant that I grew up eating out at. </p>
            <h3 class="sub-section">Finding Problems:</h3>
            <p class="p1-response">These are my observations on the website for Grandma's Country Kitchen. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learnability: How easy is the interface to learn? It seems to be pretty easy to learn as there are distinct sections such as Amenities and the Latest Feedback which is pretty self-explanatory. </li>
                <li>Memorability: How easy is it to recall what to do? This is also a big problem about this interface—specifically the amenities section. Looking at the amenities section, 
                    there are a ton of different amenities listed out where things are checked or not checked. However, since there are so many options, it leads to the middle of the website to be extremely cluttered. One of the main problems is to clean up the amenities section to make it more intuitive without overwhelming the user with information. </li>
                <li>Efficiency: Can typical tasks be done quickly? Some typical tasks can be done efficiently in this interface. For instance, there is a maps section that shows you exactly where the restaurant is located, 
                    and there is a call button that allows you to call the restaurant for any questions. Both options can be done conveniently. However, the main part of a restaurant, in my opinion, is looking at the menu to see what the restaurant provides; however, after looking over the website, there does not seem to be a menu section that provides this information to the user. 
                    Therefore, the main problem about this website is that there is no menu section that showcases food/drink options which is a problem that I hope to fix in my redesign. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p1-response">Overall, through this redesign, I hope to add a menu section and clear up the amenities section to make it more intuitive to the user when navigating through the interface. </p>
            <h3 class="sub-section">Accessibility Concerns</h3>
            <img src="assets/gck_accessibility.png" alt="gck gck_accessibility">
            <p class="p1-response">Above is a screenshot of the WebAIM WAVE report that outlines that there are 12 contrast errors in the interface. Specifically, this has to do with the size and color of text throughout the interface. I agree that this will lead to accessibility concerns for individuals with visual impairment
                 because this low contrast would make it harder to see certain information. Specifically, the amenities section will be extremely difficult for visually impaired users to navigate as there is just so much cluttered information centered on the screen. Therefore, an important part of my redesign will be increasing
                  the size of the text and making sure that there is a high contrast between the text and the background. </p>

            <p class="p2-response">This section included setting a timer for 9 minutes and doing one possible sketch for the interface each minute. This forced me to
                think out of the box, and it was pretty difficult to think of designs each minute, but the following results are below!

        <div class="context-paragraph">
            <p class="p3-response">For this part, using all of the sketches, lo-fi wireframes, and hi-fi prototypes that I created before, I redesigned Grandma's Country Kitchen 
                using HTML/CSS. While it isn't fully interactive, the main overall design and layout of the website is included. Additionally, 
                it's important to note that the final design wasn't exactly the same as the final mockup which can happen in the development phase, but for the most part, 
                the final redesign reflects the hifi-prototypes. Additionally, when testing accessibility, I have the following screenshot of the 
                <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://justinshin6.github.io/responsive_redesign/" target="_blank">WebAIM WAVE report</a>.

                While there is just one contrast error due to the "see menu" button, for the most part, there aren't any major errors detected. Additionally, to try to make 
                this website accessible to screenreaders, I've included 31 aria-labels throughout my HTML.
